Banking Management System

Overview

This project is a Banking Management System developed using Cisco Packet Tracer. The system simulates a fully functional network infrastructure for a bank, including multiple branches, centralized data storage, and online banking capabilities. It effectively demonstrates the integration of networking and banking operations.

Key Features

Branch Networks: Each branch has its own local network designed to handle specific banking tasks efficiently.
Centralized Database: Employee and customer details are stored in a central database located at the main city branch, ensuring secure and streamlined access.
Online Banking: A dedicated system for online banking services, enabling customers to perform transactions remotely.
Seamless Communication: Fully functional inter-branch communication and data transfer.

Network Design

Branch-Level Networks:
Each branch has its own subnet to handle localized operations.
Devices include PCs, routers, and switches for staff and customer service.
Centralized Database:
A dedicated server at the main city branch hosts the employee and customer database.
Configured to allow secure access from authorized branches.
Online Banking System:
A web server and application setup enable online banking services.
Customers can access the online platform securely via the internet.
Inter-Branch Communication:
Configured using routers and switches to ensure efficient data exchange.
Proper routing protocols implemented for smooth operation.

Tools and Technologies
Cisco Packet Tracer: Used for network design and simulation.
Networking Protocols: Includes static and dynamic routing protocols, VLANs, and ACLs for enhanced security.
Database Management: Centralized storage for employee and customer details.
